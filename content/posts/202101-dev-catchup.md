After all this time of developing in Java for different industries/companies, it is a sore realization that my connection to the community of developers is rather non-existing: a couple of [Stack Overflow answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/618156/cooltea?tab=answers), a [Github account](https://github.com/cooltea713705?tab=repositories) for interview homeworks, attendances to one or two conferences ([Devoxx France](https://www.devoxx.fr) / [Agile Tour Montréal](https://www.agiletourmontreal.com)).

Still, I have been following a number of Twitter accounts (most often because of how helpful the people have been while developing for work) so I had a broad idea of what I had been missing so far: conference talks, books, JUGs, meetups. I have resolved to contribute a bit more this year, especially since I have been unemployed since last December.

After searching for resources for a bit...

> Don't google Java resources (I tried) if you want to keep up with what's new in Java but go there instead http://javais.cool (which really is missing updated profile pics and [@trisha_gee](https://twitter.com/trisha_gee)'s [Java Annotated Monthly](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/jam/)) [#javadeveloper](https://twitter.com/hashtag/javadeveloper?src=hashtag_click)

*UPDATE 2023, Dec 21*: javais.cool is no longer a thing.

... here is what I got!

# What did I find?

## The greats are everywhere:
  * [@Vlad_Mihalcea](https://twitter.com/vlad_mihalcea) answers on Stack Overflow [all the time](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1025118/vlad-mihalcea?tab=answers),
  * [Thorben Janssen](https://thorben-janssen.com) and [Baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com) (which I realize now is an army of writers) pop up every so often when googling about JPA or Spring (which often happened to me),
  * [Trisha Gee](https://trishagee.com) single-handedly writes the [Java Annotated Monthly](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/java-annotated/) ([+ YouTube playlist for the TL;DR version](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPZy-hmwOdEWuQYQQ_K383qRKmnM16xO0)) which is a great entry point to keep up with Java news.

## I an not alone

I think this article is particularly inspiring: https://neha-nsit.medium.com/how-joining-java-community-shaped-my-year-so-far-5c247388e851.
Thank you [@Neha Sardana](https://twitter.com/nehasardana09) for showing the way!

# How do I start?

## [Join a community](https://neha-nsit.medium.com/how-joining-java-community-shaped-my-year-so-far-5c247388e851)
  * I especially like that of [DEV.to](https://dev.to) / [@CodeNewbies](https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies) for how they encourage new comers to join (I'll be sure to do so).
  * I have subscribed to the [Montréal JUG](https://www.montreal-jug.org) and joined the [VJUG](https://virtualjug.com)'s Slack.

## [Find mentors](https://www.helenjoscott.com/posts/finding-a-community-mentor)

## Keep up with the community news (not just Java)

I am now following a bunch of Twitter handles + blogs (the latter using [Feedly.com](https://feedly.com)):
   * http://mtlynch.io: their writing is great! Recommended reading!
   * https://www.helenjoscott.com: discovered recently, I look forward to reading more from them.
   * https://nipafx.dev: liked their cheatsheet for Java modules
   * https://jvns.ca: love the stick figures zines and their approach to dev

 ## Attend conferences
I registered to the [jChampion](https://jchampionsconf.com) and [DawsCon](https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/dawscon/) conferences which, I am sure, will be great sources of topics.

# How do I keep going?

That's the big question. While I am unemployed and have the 'time' (parenting is a handful though) then I can make it work but what after that?

*UPDATE 2021, Jan 19:* Original tweet was removed.

'Making time for things if they are important for you' is a bit overwhelming at the moment though. Here are some of the priorities that I see myself setting:

 * I hope to keep *interacting* with people.
 * I need to *pace myself* for the long run.
 
 The objective is that at some point **I can find my place in this community of people sharing the same craft.**
