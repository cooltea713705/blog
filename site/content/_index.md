Scientist at heart, I have been working as a software developer for 11 years. 

My ambition: save the world, though I have yet to know how. It is in my nature to provide all the help I can to people around me.

I was trained in fundamental sciences, got a PhD in computer science before moving on to the industry. I specialize in Java and backend development.

I am into playing and learning to pla ygames (video, board), reading mangas.

Favorite kinds of humor: dark, puns, dad jokes.
