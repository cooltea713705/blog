[Coming from a place that does not know anything about snow](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/canada/mais-ils-deneigent-quoi-les-canadiens-s-amusent-des-francais-face-a-la-neige_2601372.html) the first winter in Montr√©al was quite something. I have learned some of the local customs over time but still have quite a lot of questions about the Quebeckers' practices with snow.

First of all, shovelling snow is a [dangerous activity](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/snow-shoveling-a-real-risk-for-heart-attack/).

Then as shown in the picture above, the snow that is shovelled from the walkway is *not* supposed to go on the lawn nor on the sidewalk but on the street to be collected by the snow plows. Why not on the lawn? Seemingly, [the salt and the gravel are bad for the grass](https://www.mlive.com/gardening/2007/08/will_shoveling_snow_off_my_law.html). Leaving the snow on the sidewalk is a no-no (but when removing snow from your car, it is kind of tolerated?).

To this day I am still wondering if I shovel *enough* but my neighbors' have not complained so far.
