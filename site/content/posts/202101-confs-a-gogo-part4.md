This is the fourth entry to the [series for the January 2021 online conferences](/posts/202101-confs-a-gogo-part1/) which I have attended. I will have one last entry for the sessions which I have watched offline.

[Victor Rentea - The Definitive Guide to Working with Exceptions in Java](https://youtu.be/LRwCE7GreSM)
: In a nutshell: use `RuntimeException`, handle those properly: enum for error codes, the management of error messages depending on the locale in the backend of the requester is pretty cool.

[Rafael Winterhalter - Tracing Distributed Microservices](https://youtu.be/HZq7vqZ5p8A)
: What happens when one wants to monitor distributed microservices? Tracing is assigning an id for a given request and this talk suggests an implementation of Application Performance Monitoring.
