As many others have done as well, I have actively been looking games to play with the family, friends, colleagues, everyone...

My best picks so far (no registration, duration is less than 30min, can accommodate any number of players):
 * [Skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io)
 * [Codenames.game](https://codenames.game)
 * [Kahoot.com](https://kahoot.com) (only the organizer has to register)

Were not tested but go along the games listed above:
 * [Insider-online.herokuapp.com](http://insider-online.herokuapp.com/)
 * [SecretHitler.io](https://private.secrethitler.io)
 * [The Hogwarts Escape](https://www.thehogwartsescape.com)

Here are curated lists:
